# odin-recipes
today in this project I created a recipe page using relative and asolute links
I used absolute links to brings users to the recipe for the website
I used relative links on the homepage of my webpage to see the recipes locally
unordered and ordered list were also used
I had to create a paragraph using the P attribute
other attributes that were used are title, head, body, html, etc
I downloaded images from the internet to use for the webpage
